# Full Stack Project (React + Node.js)

This is a full-stack web application built with **React (Vite)** on the frontend and **Node.js (Express)** on the backend. It uses **local file storage** instead of a database to persist data. The frontend communicates with the backend through a scalable custom React hook for HTTP requests. Styling is handled using **vanilla CSS**.
